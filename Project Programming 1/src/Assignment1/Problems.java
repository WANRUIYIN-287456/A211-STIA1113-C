	/* PROBLEM : Nowadays, technology is more advanced and we have now smart watches.  
		We can use smart watches to track our fitness while doing sports. 
		Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 4 is an activity tracker which is also a type of the smart watches. 
        However, this device does not enable the user to set the daily goal for burning calories.
        Although the smart watch is able to display time exercised, distance travelled 
        and calories burned for exercising, the user is not sure about the speed of exercising 
        and the duration of time the user still needs to exercise to achieve the daily goal.

        Calculate speed, uses the time taken, distance travelled and 
        calories burned to determine the duration to reach the goal.
        more flexible and more accurate.
